    "The convex hull of a set of points is the smallest convex set that contains all the points (including those on the boundary.) For a finite set of points, the convex hull will be a convex polytope.\n",
    "\n",
    "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_hull\n",
    "\n",
    "This code finds the convex hull of Matt's Christmas tree. It then removes the points that are on the hull and finds the convex hull of the remaining points; this is repeated until all points have been processed. This creates sets of points that are nested within each other, like a matrioskha doll or an onion. There is probably a better algorithm in terms of time complexity for finding all the layers but this was pretty easy to code.\n",
    "\n",
    "The python class below finds the nested hulls and allows easy assignment of colours to the different layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Related to the convex hull, the \"alpha shape\" is the same idea except the sets are allowed to be a \"little bit\" concave, as defined by a parameter alpha. This is useful in practical settings where we may want to be a little less strict about the layers and could give a more pleasing look.\n",
